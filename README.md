# üê±‚Äçüë§ MineCraft - Weekend assignment
I was given a task @AppleSeeds Bootcamp to make a dice rollong game while only using ```JavaScript```, ```HTML``` & ```CSS``` 

The basic task was to make a dice game with the specifications given in writing and a video.

<br />

### My design was straightforward and simple and I made sure to include:


#### 6-6 reset the current points and move turn
whenever a 6-6 dice is rolled the player lose his turn and all the current points.

#### All basic rules set in place
every player can role the dice until he uses 'hold' and if a player reach the target points he win, if he pass the target points he loss


#### Styling same as original
I was trying to make the basic game look almost the same as the original game from the specs

#### Themes
I decided to add some color themes for fun so you can pick one out of 3 different styles

#### App responsiveness
I made sure that the app is useable for smaller screens as well.
